Installation instruction on InstrVislizr

    Please update the makefile file with the correct path to Euterpea.  All you need to do is type
    "make" in the terminal and if the Euterpea is located successfully, this should work.
    Let me know if there's any issues.

    Instruction on how to use the file is presented in paper.pdf .  Please take a look.

    Optional: change the ".ghci" file to reflect the right path to Euterpea/src and Euterpea/dist/build.  This way the path is automatically loaded when you run "ghci" under the current folder (that contains ".ghci" file.

    For Windows without makefile utility, instead of running "make", just copy the command that is put in the makefile and run in the command line.  Bascially:

    To Compile and run ./main (or main.exe on windows) for demo:
    ghc --make main.hs -i<path_to_Euterpea>/src:<path_to_Euterpea>/dist/build


    For ghci:
    ghci -i<path_to_Euterpea>/src:<path_to_Euterpea>/dist/build
